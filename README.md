# Bismillah ar-Rahman ar-Rahim

The Quran is a book that judges between right and wrong.
[Quran 25:1](https://perfectquran.co/25/1). Therefore, by following its commands
and abstaining from what it prohibits, we can adhere to the middle-path that was
chosen for us by our Lord.

__PerfectQuran__ is a web app designed to make Quranic Ayat accessible to a new
generation of social media savvy Muslims. By getting Ayat where they will be
read, we aim to educate ourselves on the true message of Allah. Thereby,
guarding ourselves and others from the scourge of extremism and playing a
positive role in our communities.
