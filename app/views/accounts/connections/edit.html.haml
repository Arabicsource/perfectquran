          .message-body.content
            %p 
              Alhamdulillah, I'm super excited about finally starting to allow
              automatic posting. This was the distinguishing feature that made
              PerfectQuran so popular in the past.

            %p
              There are a few points of note:

            %ul
              %li For the moment this only works with Twitter
              %li This will post one ayah of Quran every hour to your Twitter account
              %li It only Tweets ayahs from The Noble Quran English translation
              %li It functions exactly as you can see on the #{link_to('PerfectQuran Twitter', 'https://twitter.com/perfectquran')} account

            %p
              If that works for you, just change the connection status to active
              and enjoy.

            %p
              If that's not quite what you want, drop me an email (quran.is.perfect@gmail.com)
              and let me know how I can make it more suitable for your needs.

            %p
              I only have a limited amount of time to work on this project. If I
              know your needs, I can prioritize them.

            %p
              With love,
              Your Brother
